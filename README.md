# UniverseTime

This is a responsive website involving my two passions: web-development and space. The site includes usage of Bootstrap cards, carousel and forms. HTML is utilized throughout the page, with Javascript sprinked in. Lastly, styled with custom CSS including usage of CSS grid. This was created as a project for fun, but can be easily transitioned into other topics/designs.

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
